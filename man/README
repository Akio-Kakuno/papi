		The above two usages are identical; they call all three targets below.
	make clean
		Remove stray files from the man1 and man3 directories.
	make install-man MANDIR=<mandir>
		Install just the man pages.
	make install-doc DOCDIR=<docdir>
		Install all other documentation files.

Philosophy:

  Man pages are the lowest common denominator for PAPI documentation.
  Currently, all PAPI functionality is first documented as a man page.
  From there, it is converted into a collection of linked html pages
  using the perl script in this directory. Additionally, using tools
  in the /papi/doc directory, it is also converted into a Programmer's
  Reference and formatted as a Word .doc file, a PDF file, a PostScript
  file, and a single html file. All these formats are accessible on the
  PAPI website and installed with the install-doc option.
  Any content changes or additions must be made to the man pages and
  propagated forward from there.
