10/1/00	- Fixed native encoding bug on all platforms
9/1/00	- Fixed T3E Mhz bug
8/1/00	- T3E Fortran bugs fixed
7/1/00  - Fortran string handling is seriously inept. (fixed thanks
	  to Nils Smeds, Anders Nilsson)
5/31/00 - John May: expand_dynamic_array is broken. (fixed in 1.1)
5/31/00 - John May: PAPI_cleanup_eventset is *still* broken. (fixed in 1.1)

	  thanks to Charles Aldarondo of Cray)
5/31/00 - 64 bit Cycle counter may wrap. (not worth fixing, OS's don't even
	  worry about this. Why?)
5/31/00 - PAPI_create_eventset needs it's arg to be set to PAPI_NULL first.
	  (fixed in 1.1)

3/8/00 	- PAPI (Linux x86) is reporting a single cpu on SMP systems 
	  (fixed in 1.0)
3/8/00 	- Robert Bell: I have noticed that there seems to be something
	  amiss with thread support on linux and irix in Papi (though I have only
	  tested on those two platforms). (fixed in 1.0)
