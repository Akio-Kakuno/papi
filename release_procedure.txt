Release Procedure for PAPI  November 07, 2006

Below is a step-wise procedure for making a PAPI release.
This is a living document and may not be totally current or accurate.
It is an attempt to capture current practice in making a PAPI release.
Please update it as appropriate.

One way to use this procedure is to print a copy and check off
the lines as they are completed to avoid confusion.
================================================================================
__ 1. Notify developers that a release is imminent and the repository should be
	considered frozen.

__ 2. Check/Change the version number in: papi.h, configure.in, Makefile.in;
	and commit to cvs if needed.

__ 2a. If configure.is changed, run autoconf (2.61) 
	and commit the resulting configure.

__ 3. Create a ChangeLog for the current release. 
	- One handy way to do this is to use the python script that comes with
	WinCVS:
	  Macros->CVS->Build ChangeLog (advanced).
	Use the -r<branch>: command to log commit messages from the previous 
	branch point to the present.

__ 4. Scan the ChangeLog to remove extraneous fluff, like perfctr or perfmon imports.

__ 5. Modify RELEASENOTES.txt to summarize the major changes listed in the log.

__ 6. Add ChangeLogXYZ.txt to cvs and commit both ChangeLogXYZ.txt and 
	RELEASENOTES.txt.

__ 7. Export the PAPI FAQ to PAPI_FAQ.html in case anything changed.

__ 8. Update and commit any man pages that changed.

__ 9. Update and commit any other documentation that changed.

__ 10. Branch cvs.

__ 11. Export the branch to a clean working directory:
	> cvs export -r <branch> <module> ex:
	> cvs export -r papi-3-2-0 papi

__ 12. Delete any unneccessary files or directories
		particularly .doc and .pdf files in the /doc directory

__ 13. Rename the directory from papi to papi-X.Y.Z

__ 14. tar the directory:
	> tar -cvf papi-X.Y.Z.tar papi-X.Y.Z

__ 15. zip the tarball:
	gzip papi-X.Y.Z.tar

__ 16. Copy the tarball to icl:/sw/www/icl/projects/papi/downloads

__ 17. Check permissions on the tarball. 664 is good. 

__ 18. Create a link with supporting text on the PAPI software web page.

__ 19. Create a News item on the PAPI Web page.

__ 20. Email the papi developer and discussion lists with an announcement.
