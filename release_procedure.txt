Release Procedure for PAPI  Apr 17, 2012 (now with git!)

Below is a step-wise procedure for making a PAPI release.
This is a living document and may not be totally current or accurate.
It is an attempt to capture current practice in making a PAPI release.
Please update it as appropriate.

One way to use this procedure is to print a copy and check off
the lines as they are completed to avoid confusion.
================================================================================
__ 0a. Notify developers that a release is imminent and the repository should be
	considered frozen.

__ 0b. Update your local copy from git to make sure you have all changes.
	git pull

__ 1. Update any documentation that may have changed. Pay particular attention
	to INSTALL.txt.

__ 2. Check/Change the version number in: papi.spec, papi.h, configure.in, Makefile.in,
	Doxyfile-common (PROJECT_NUMBER) ; and commit to the repo.

-- 2a. On most icl machines:
	export PATH=/mnt/scratch/sw/doxygen-1.7.4/bin:$PATH
	-- or --
	setenv PATH /mnt/scratch/sw/doxygen-1.7.4/bin:$PATH

-- 2b. Rebuild the doxygen manpages (  cd doc && make && make install )
	You will want to check if anything needs to be committed to git.
	(Usually the $(papi_dir)/man/man1 and man3 directories)

-- 2c. Update the website docs; 
	We use Doxyfile-html for this, 
	newgrp papi		# changes your defacto group to papi (starts a new shell)
	$(papi_dir)/doc make clean html
	rm -rf /silk/homes/icl/projectsdev/papi/docs/* 
	cp -R doc/html/* /silk/homes/icl/projectsdev/papi/docs;
	chmod -R 775 /silk/homes/icl/projectsdev/papi/docs

__ 3. If configure.in is changed, run autoconf (2.59) and commit the resulting
	configure file.
	NOTE: Using an autoconf version >2.59 will work, but will produce an 
	inordinate number of extraneous differences between versions.

__ 4. Create a ChangeLog for the current release. 
	We use a python script gitlog2changelog.py to generate is for us. 
	It expects the tag of the last release as an argument. 
	./gitlog2changelog.py papi-a-b-c-t
	mv ChangeLog ChangeLogP4XYZ.txt

__ 5. Scan the ChangeLog to remove extraneous fluff, like perfctr imports.

__ 6. Modfy RELEASENOTES.txt to summarize the major changes listed in the log.

__ 7. Add ChangeLogXYZ.txt to git and commit both ChangeLogXYZ.txt and 
	RELEASENOTES.txt.

__ 8. If this is not an incremental release, branch git. 
	git checkout -b stable-X.Y [starting point eg master]

__ 9. Tag git: papi-X-Y-Z-t.
	git tag -a papi-X-Y-Z-t

__ 10. Push everything to the central repo. 
	git push --tags 
	-- or -- If you've created a new branch. 
	git push --tags origin stable-X.Y: 

__ 11. Copy your working directory to papi-X.Y.Z
	> cp -R papi papi-X.Y.X
	> cd papi-X.Y.Z

__ 12. Delete any unneccessary files or directories
		particularly .doc and .pdf files in the /doc directory
	Things needed in /doc {Doxyfile, Doxyfile-everything}
        You can use the delete_before_release.sh script for this.
	NOTE: This deletes the .git directory, 

__ 13. tar the directory:
	> tar -cvf papi-X.Y.Z.tar papi-X.Y.Z

__ 14. zip the tarball:
	gzip papi-X.Y.Z.tar

__ 15. Copy the tarball to /silk/homes/icl/projects/papi/downloads

__ 16. Check permissions on the tarball. 664 is good. 

__ 17. Create a link with supporting text on the PAPI software web page.

__ 18. Create a News item on the PAPI Web page.

__ 19. Email the papi developer and discussion lists with an announcement.

__ 20. Post the announcement on the PAPI User Forum.

Patch Procedure for PAPI  January 29, 2010

Below is a step-wise procedure for making a PAPI patch.

One way to use this procedure is to print a copy and check off
the lines as they are completed to avoid confusion.
================================================================================
__ 0. Make sure you're on the branch you want to patch against. 
	> git branch 
	* stable-5.0

__1. Generate the patch. 
	> git diff -p papi-5-0-0-t stable-5.0 > papi-5-0-1.patch

__ 2. Apply the patch.
	> wget http://icl.cs.utk.edu/projects/papi/downloads/papi-5.0.0.tar.gz
	> tar xzf papi-5.0.0.tar.gz && cd papi-5.0.0
	> patch -p1 ../papi-5-0-1.patch

__ 3. If the patch applied cleanly, build and test on affected platforms;
         otherwise clean up the patch and try again.

__ 4. Copy the diff file to icl:/sw/www/icl/projects/papi/downloads/patches

__ 5. Check permissions on the diff. 644 is good. 

__ 6. Create a link with supporting text on the PAPI software web page.

__ 7. Create a News item on the PAPI Web page.

__ 8. Email the papi discussion list with an announcement.

__ 9. Post the announcement on the PAPI User Forum.
