This package provides a library, called libpfm, which can be used
to develop monitoring tools which use the IA-64 Performance Monitoring Unit (PMU). 

This version of libpfm supports BOTH the Itanium (Merced) and Itanium2 (McKinley, 
Madison, Deerfield) processors.

The core library is generic and does not depend on the Linux/ia64 perfmon interface. 
It is possible to use it on other IA-64 operating systems (some adjustments may still be needed).

WHAT'S THERE
-------------
	- the library source code including support for Itanium and Itanium2 and generic IA64 PMU

	- a set of examples showing how the library can be used on Linux/ia64 with a perfmon-2.x 
	  interface

	- a set of header library files and the perfmon-2 kernel interface headers

	- man pages for all the library entry points

INSTALLATION
------------
	- edit config.mk to :
		- update some of the configuration variables
		- make your compiler options
		- select which PMU you want to support. Multiple PMU can be supported by a single
		  library

	- type make
	- type make install

REQUIREMENTS:
-------------
	- to run the examples, you MUST be using a linux kernel version of 2.6.0-test5 or higher.
	  In other words, a kernel with a perfmon interface version 2.x.
	  
DOCUMENTATION
-------------
	- man pages for all entry points
	- More information can be found on library web site: http://www.hpl.hp.com/research/linux/perfmon
