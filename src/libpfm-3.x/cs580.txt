counting sort:
  the idea is to compare each pair of keys, counting how many are less
than each particular one;

  ((compare Kj with Ki) for 1<=j<=i) for 1<i <=N

Shell sort:

 An in-place sort algorithm which repeatedly reorders different, small subsets
 of the input until the entire array is ordered. On each pass it sorts i sets
 of n/i items, where n is the total number of items to sort. Each set is every
 ith item, e.g. set 1 is item 1, 1+i, 1+2i, etc., set 2 is item 2, 2+i, etc. 
Typically each set is sorted with an insertion sort. On each succeeding pass,
 the increment, i, is reduced until it is 1 for the last pass.
