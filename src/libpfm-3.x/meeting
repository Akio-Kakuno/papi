SC2002 Dynaprof SW TODO

1.Java GUI modifications 
1.Make it handle command line input into the console window. Use 'input'
executable to test.
2.Make the output to the console window asynchronous. Use 'fspx'
executable to test.
2.Run fspx under dynaprof on an Intel PIII
1.On the top 4 functions (found in SC2002 Slides) with metrics
PAPI_TOT_CYC and PAPI_TOT_INS and compute IPC.
2.Integrate results into SC2002 Supplement Slides
3.Get top 4 functions by running ex19 from PetSC under gprof on a Power
3 with 4 processors.
4.Run ex19 from PetSC under dynaprof on a Power 3 with 4 processors.
1.On the top 4 functions with metrics PAPI_TOT_CYC and PAPI_TOT_INS and
compute IPC. 
2.Integrate results into SC2002 Supplement Slides
5.Document trapper and check in documentation into source tree.
6.Test that mpiload command does what it says it should. 
7.Test and document in Dynaprof User's Guide mpich script command
8.Test and document in Dynaprof User's Guide mpi shell script command
9.In dynaprof, make delete point work
1.Just delete the instrumentation. Any data will be preserved.
10.Make Instr/Run/Instr add point work
1.This means we need a probe-reallocate/probe-reinit
11.Test perfometer for serial case
12. Make mpiperfometerprobe work with MPI executables
13. Make Vprof probe
14. Adapt perfometer probe for discovery of threads using trapper
15. Adapt vprof probe for discovery of threads using trapper
