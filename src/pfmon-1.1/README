This package provides a library and a sample tool to monitor performance
using the IA-64 Performance Monitoring Unit (PMU). This package relies
on the Linux/ia64 kernel support for the PMU (perfmon).

          -----> YOU MUST at least HAVE kernel v2.4.18 or v2.5.3 <-----

In this package you will find:

	- a generic helper library (libpfm) and header files (include)

	- the pfmon tool (pfmon) which collects performance data on unmodified
	  binaries or for the entire system (UP & SMP).

	- a set of examples (examples) showing how the kernel and library can be
	  used outside of pfmon.

	- a small set of test programs (tests) including pfdbg to turn on/off 
	  kernel perfmon debugging. 

	- a simple script (scripts) to collect a cycle breakdown using pfmon.

	- a user's guide (docs) for pfmon.
