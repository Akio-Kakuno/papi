Linux 2.4 Native Event Notes
----------------------------

For *all* the native event codes, see the website at

		http://www.sandpile.org

The native event counter format is:

	event_code = 16 bit event selector code and unit mask.
	hw_counter_num = Event register number 0 through 1, (2 or 3 on K7).
			
	event = (event_code << 8) | (hw_counter_num).
