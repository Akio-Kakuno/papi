The new PAPI substrate for Alpha Tru64 Unix uses the Dynamic Access to
DCPI Data (DADD) API from Hewlett-Packard (formerly Compaq).  DADD is assumed
to be installed in /usr/local/dadd.  Because DCPI uses instruction sampling
to collect performance data, the counts for PAPI events are estimated from
these samples.  For this reason, very short running programs instrumented
with PAPI may show undercounts as low as zero.
