The PAPI substrate for HP Alpha Tru64 UNIX uses the Dynamic Access
to DCPI Data (DADD) API from Hewlett-Packard.
DADD is assumed to be installed in
  /usr/lib/dcpi  (dadd.a)
  /usr/include/dcpi (dadd.h, virtual_counters.h)
  /usr/local/dadd  (dcpid)

DCPI uses instruction sampling to collect performance data, and the
DADD counts for PAPI events are estimated from these samples.
For this reason, very short running programs instrumented
with PAPI may show undercounts as low as zero.
