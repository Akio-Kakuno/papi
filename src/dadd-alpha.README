DCPI Data (DADD) API from Hewlett-Packard (formerly Compaq).
DADD is assumed to be installed in
  /usr/lib/dcpi  (dadd.a)
  /usr/include/dcpi (dadd.h, virtual_counters.h)
  /usr/local/dadd  (dcpid)

Because DCPI uses instruction sampling to collect performance data,
the DADD counts for PAPI events are estimated from
these samples.  For this reason, very short running programs instrumented
with PAPI may show undercounts as low as zero.
