- Add buffering to i-mode vperfctrs.

- Add interrupt support to global-mode perfctrs.

- On 2.4 make /proc/self/perfctr a symlink to "perfctr:[XXXX]"
  so that the open file descriptor can be identified as a perfctr
  object.

- Put 2.4 and 2.2 VFS code in separate files, at least for virtual.

- Use the "rewrite function call sites" trick to get rid of the
  process scheduling callback function pointers.
  (Only relevant when the driver is a module.)

- Global-mode perfctrs need some form of access control mechanism.

- Implement perfctr multiplexing.
  Use a timer to cycle through a <control,counter> array.

- Add support for other architectures.
  Start with the relatively straightforward UltraSPARC.

- Add Documentation/perfctr/ ?

- Pentium MMX and Pentium Pro have errata which affect SMM and CR4.
  Will this hit us, or is it a problem for the BIOS to solve?
