Test PAPI across fork and exec with perfmon and perfctr.

Perfmon: Need PAPI_shutdown() in the parent before fork() and re-init
after, or else PAPI_stop() in the child also kills the parent's
overflow interrupts.  Also, PAPI_shutdown() in the child doesn't help.

Perfctr: Need PAPI_shutdown() in the parent before exec(), or else
PAPI in the child dies with "Profiling timer expired".  Again,
PAPI_shutdown() after the exec() doesn't seem to help.
