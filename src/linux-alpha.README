The PAPI linux-alpha substrate uses the linux iprobe_4.3 driver and library
from Compaq (now HP). This needs to be patched, because not all of
the EV6 functions are in the library. Unpack the iprobe code in the usual way,
and copy the patch in papi-2.1.0/src/alpha-linux/iprobe.patch to the top of
the iprobe directory. Then

patch -Np1 < iprobe.patch

After that, build and install iprobe according to directions, and set 
IPROBE_HOME in papi/src/Makefile.linux-alpha.
