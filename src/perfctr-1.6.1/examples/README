This directory contains some example programs which illustrate how
the Linux x86 performance-monitoring counters interface may be used.

command/
	NOT OPERATIONAL, USES OBSOLETE DRIVER FACILITIES
	Shows how a program can run another program
	while controlling its perfctrs.
	Fully developed, this would be a perfctr
	analogue of the `time' command.

global/
	Shows how to set up and monitor global-mode perfctrs.
	Fully developed, this would be a perfctr analogue
	of the `top' or `ps' command.

inherit/
	Illustrates inheritance of virtual per-process perfctrs
	from parent to child processes.

self/
	Shows how a program can use the perfctrs to
	monitor the execution in parts of its own code.
