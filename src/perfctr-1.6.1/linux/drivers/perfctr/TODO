- On 2.4 make /proc/self/perfctr a symlink to "perfctr:[XXXX]"
  so that the open file descriptor can be identified as a perfctr
  object, just like those constructed via /dev/perfctr's ATTACH op.

- Put 2.4 and 2.2 VFS code in separate files, at least for virtual.

- Check how the VIA Cyrix III really identifies itself.
  Alan Cox has stated that cpuid actually returns "CentaurHauls".

- add inode_count() and dentry_count() wrappers to compat.h

- 2.4.0-test4 dropped the big kernel lock around file operations.
  Check if additional locks are needed in this driver.
  vperfctr_mmap()'s safety depends on remap_page_range()'s.

- Use the "rewrite function call sites" trick to get rid of the
  process scheduling callback function pointers.

- Global-mode perfctrs need some form of access control mechanism.

- Enable P6 local APIC and let perfctr overflows interrupt.
  How this feature should be used has yet to be decided, but
  global-mode counters could use it to eliminate the sampling timer.

  A problem with APIC overflow interrupts is that we probably
  have to disable/enable them at process suspend/resume, which
  is expensive and different from our usual "lazy" evntsel updates.

- Acquire docs on K7 Model 2 local APIC.

- Implement perfctr multiplexing.
  Use a timer to cycle through a <control,counter> array.

- Add support for other architectures.
  Start with the relatively straightforward UltraSPARC,

- Add Documentation/perfctr.txt?

- CONFIG option for /dev/perfctr? Might be useful to just add
  the hardware drivers and let the kernel use them as-is.

- Pentium MMX and Pentium Pro have errata which affect SMM and CR4.
  Will this hit us, or is it a problem for the BIOS to solve?
