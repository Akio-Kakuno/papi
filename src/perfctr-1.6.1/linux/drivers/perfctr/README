Performance-Monitoring Counters Driver
Copyright (C) 1999-2000  Mikael Pettersson <mikpe@csd.uu.se>

Supported processors
====================
- This driver supports all x86-type processors known to have
  performance-monitoring counters, i.e. all Intel family 5
  and 6 processors (Pentium/MMX/Pro/II/III/Celeron/Xeon)
  the AMD K7 Athlon, and the Cyrix 6x86MX/MII/III processors.

- The WinChip C6, 2, and 3 processors are supported, if the
  kernel was built with the CONFIG_PERFCTR_WINCHIP
  option and without the CONFIG_X86_TSC option.

- Generic x86 processors with a time-stamp counter but no
  performance-monitoring counters, such as the AMD K6 family.
  For these processors, only TSC-based cycle-count measurements
  are possible.

Supported services
==================
- Virtualised per-process performance-monitoring counters are
  supported, if the driver was built with CONFIG_PERFCTR_VIRTUAL.
- Global-mode performance-monitoring counters for UP and SMP are
  supported, if the driver was built with CONFIG_PERFCTR_GLOBAL.
