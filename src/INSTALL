How to install PAPI on your system
----------------------------------

1) Pick the appropriate Makefile.<arch> for your system, edit it
   and compile.

   % make -f Makefile.<arch>

2) Check for errors. Look for the libpapi.a and libpapi.so 
   in the current directory. Optionally run the test programs
   in the 'ftests' and 'tests' directories. Not all tests will
   succeed on all platforms.  

   % ./run_tests.sh
  
   will run the tests in quiet mode, which will print PASSED, FAILED, or
   SKIPPED.  Tests are SKIPPED if the functionality being tested is not
   supported by that platform.

3) Create a PAPI binary distribution or install PAPI directly.

   To directly install PAPI from the build tree:

   % make -f Makefile.<arch> DESTDIR=<install-dir> install

   Please use an absolute pathname for <install-dir>, not a relative pathname.

   To create a binary kit, papi-<arch>.tgz:

   % make -f Makefile.<arch> dist
