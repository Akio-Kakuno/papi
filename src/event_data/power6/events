##410A8
This signal is asserted when the branch execution unit detects a branch mispredict because the CR value is opposite of the predicted value. This signal is asserted after a branch issue event and will result in a branch redirect flush if not overridden by a flush of an older instruction.
#5,v,g,n,n,PM_BR_MPRED_TA,Branch mispredictions due to target address
##410AC
branch miss predict due to a target address prediction. This signal will be asserted each time the branch execution unit detects an incorrect target address prediction. This signal will be asserted after a valid branch execution unit issue and will cause a branch mispredict flush unless a flush is detected from an older instruction.
