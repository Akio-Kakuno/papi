Native event code can be found in /usr/include/asm/perf.h. 

The counter format is:

	(code << 8) | (hw_counter_num).

hw_counter_num is current:

0 - Hardware counter 0
1 - Hardware counter 1
2 - Process virtualized TSC

Hardware counter number 2 only counts 1 thing: it counts the cycles 
your process has been on the run queue. This is not used in PAPI.
