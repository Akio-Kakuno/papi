Some native event code info can be found in /usr/include/asm/perf.h. 

The counter format is:

	(code << 8) | (hw_counter_num).

hw_counter_num is current:

0 - Hardware counter 0
1 - Hardware counter 1

Code can be 16 bits corresponding to the 16 bits of the event
selector and unit mask of the Pentium's registers.
