The parse.pl perl script is used to facilitate the creation of the PAPI mapping tables by using the manual files. 

The script creates new.[ch] files containing the basic information of the performance counters provided by the man. The user just needs to add the header and footer code to both files. Use other mapping files as a reference.

The input, at least for Core/Core2/Atom, derives directly from the (3) pmc.* files. The file must contain many entries following this pattern (see atom.txt and/or core.txt as a reference):

* COUNTER
* DESCRIPTION
* EMPTY LINE
