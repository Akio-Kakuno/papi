Both n32-bit and 64-bit libraries are built.  To use the shared libraries, 
you will need to set LD_LIBRARYN32_PATH (LD_LIBRARY64_PATH) to the location of
the n32-bit libpapi.so (64-bit libpapi64.so).

Native Encoding for IRIX v6.x on MIPS R10K and R12K processors


The encoding for native (NON-PAPI) events is:
	
		Low 8 bits indicate which event number: 0 - 31

Hardware multiplexing is in use, you can count all 32 events.

See: man r10k_counters
