Title: Native Encoding for AIX 4.3.x on IBM Power 630, 604 and 604e

The encoding for native (NON-PAPI) events is:

		Low 8 bits indicate which counter number: 0 - 7
		Bits 8-16 indicate which event number: 0 - 50

See: /usr/lpp/pmtoolkit/lib/<arch>.evs

For threaded programs, you had better:

setenv AIXTHREAD_SCOPE S

Test case notes:

All FPU counts for the test cases will be half of the expected values,
because the Power has a FMADD instruction.
