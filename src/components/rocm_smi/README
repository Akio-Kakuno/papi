@section Component Specific Information

rocm_smi/ 

Support for ROCM_SMI (System Management Interface) library.

General information
-------------------

The PAPI ROCM_SMI component allows the user to read things like the
temperature, fan speed, and power consumption of an AMD GPU device.
It can also be used to set limits on the power consumption or fan 
speed, using a PAPI_write() interface.

How to install PAPI with the ROCM component?
-------------------------------------------- 

This component uses the ROCM location from the environment (or looks
for /opt/rocm by default). Please set ROCM_DIR and RPL_DIR during
builds so that the component can find the required header files.

Configure PAPI with ROCM enabled.  
    % cd src
    % ./configure --prefix=some_location --with-components="rocm_smi"

Build with ROCM_DIR specified, and LD_LIBRARY_PATH must include the
path to librocm_smi64.so.

The compile must have as an -I directory the path to rocm_smi.h.
  
    % export ROCM_DIR=/opt/rocm
    % make 

To find a list of ROCM_SMI supported events.
    % utils/papi_native_avail | grep rocm_smi

TESTING, for ICL workers
-------------------------------------------- 

These instructions are specific to the ICL environment; but may be useful to
users if translated to their own working or testing environments.

ICL testing was done (April 2019) on the ICL system "caffeine"; which has AMD
equipment installed, and the ROCM interface software installed at /opt/rocm.

The software requires environment variables to be defined. 

A shell script in papi/src/components/rocm/tests/run_papi.sh will export various
environment variables, but (naturally) they go away when the shell exits. If you
want to execute commands and programs from the command line instead, export the 
same environment variables from the command line, but then don't use run_papi.sh.

Note, these paths are specific to the ICL test system  'caffeine'. If you are not
on that system, you will need to find the appropriate rocm directory paths for  
LD_LIBRARY_PATH, and ROCP_METRICS. For example on another system, we have seen
them installed at /opt/rocm/opencl/lib/x86_64 and /opt/rocm/hsa/lib.

These exports assume you have papi installed in your $HOME directory.
You will probably have to change the 2nd 'export LD_LIBRARY_PATH', 
the current one requires rocm_smi_lib to be installed and built in 
the user's directory. 

ICLers copy-and-paste these to the command line:

# These ONLY for Caffeine.
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/rocm_src/lib/hsa:/opt/rocm/lib/:$HOME/papi/src/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=~/rocm_smi_lib/build/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export ROCP_METRICS=/opt/rocm/lib/metrics.xml
export ROCPROFILER_LOG=1
export HSA_VEN_AMD_AQLPROFILE_LOG=1
export AQLPROFILE_READ_API=1

# THESE for Instinct:
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/papi/src/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export ROCP_METRICS=/opt/rocm/rocprofiler/lib/metrics.xml 
export ROCPROFILER_LOG=1
export HSA_VEN_AMD_AQLPROFILE_LOG=1
export AQLPROFILE_READ_API=1
