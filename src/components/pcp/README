General Information
-------------------

/*TODO*/
/*HJ: will add more details*/
+++ This component only supports the 
    Performance Metrics Domain agent: pmda=perfevent
...
+++ Purpose: Enable monitoring of P9 next event via PCP without
             elevated privilege.
...
+++ P9 nest counters: any number of counters can be monitored
                      at any time. Meaning, there is no limitation
                      similar to P9 core counter monitoring, which
                      is limited to the number of counters (on P9
                      there are 6 counters: 4 programmable and
                      2 fixed (cycles, instructions completed).

How to install PAPI with the PCP component?
-------------------------------------------

This PAPI PCP component has been developed and tested using PCP
version 3.12.2.

This component uses the PCP location from the environment (or looks
for /usr by default).  Please set PCP_DIR during builds so that
the component can find the required header files and library.

Configure PAPI with PCP enabled.
    % cd src
    % ./configure --prefix=<prefix-location> --with-components="pcp"

Build with PCP_DIR specified
    % export PCP_DIR=/usr
    % make && make install

Testing the component requires that libraries for PAPI and PCP
can be found or are statically linked in to the executable.  You may
need to add the library directories as shown here.

    % export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${PCP_DIR}/lib64:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}

For general information on how to create and run components, the user
is referred to the INSTALL.txt section "CREATING AND RUNNING
COMPONENTS".


To check if PCP was successfully installed with PAPI.
    % <prefix-location>/bin/papi_component_avail

To find a list of PCP supported events.
    % <prefix-location>/bin/papi_native_avail | grep pcp
