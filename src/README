PAPI Debugging
--------------

1) To compile with debugging, define CFLAGS to include -DDEBUG in the Makefile.

2) To enable debugging messages at run time, set the PAPI_DEBUG environment
   variable to one or more of the following.
 
  (SUBSTRATE|API|INTERNAL|THREADS|MULTIPLEX|OVERFLOW|PROFILE|ALL)

PAPI Configure
--------------

configure script is the utility to help user pick the right native Makefile.

1)  with specify --prefix=<path>, "make install" can install the library into the
    right place

2)  with specify --with-bitmode=64 on a platform which can support both 32 and 64
    bit mode to build a 64 bit mode library. the default is 32 bit mode or the only 
    bit mode the platform can support.
