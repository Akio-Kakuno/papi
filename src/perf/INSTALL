1) Patch your kernel.

  Choose the appropiate patch file for your source tree.  (The included
  patch is for kernel version 2.0.36 and 2.2.5. Your mileage may vary.)

  $ patch -l -p1 < /wherever/you/unpacked/me/perf/perf-patch-2.x.x

2) Configure the kernel build.

  Turn on performance monitoring in the kernel configuration.
  Under general setup, select PPro/686 as the processor type and
  then turn on CPU performance counter support.

 - Compile/Install your kernel. (if you don't know how, quit now.)
 - Reboot using the new kernel.

3) Compile the library.

   The library depends on the include files in /usr/include/linux.
   This file should be linked to ../src/linux/include/linux.

  $ make

4) [Unecessary for PAPI] Install the library and outdated documentation.

  $ make install
