CHANGES IN PAPI 3.0.7 SINCE PAPI 3.0.6
===============================================================================

Major Issues:
-------------	
* src/multiplex.c:
  - fixed an assert error that caused gcc to segfault.

* src/p3_events.c:
  - added / updated lots of Opteron event definitions.
    Thanks to Anoop Iyer at AMD!

* src/aix.c: 
  - fixed a static variable declaration in _papi_hwd_read 
    that caused events to be attributed to the wrong threads.

* src/threads.h: 
  - Added NO_TLS definition to allow us to turn off TLS storage.
    This prevented compilation on some platforms.


Bug Fixes:
----------
* src/Matlab/{PAPI_Matlab.readme, flops.readme, PAPI_flops.c}:
  - fixed some Matlab mex file and comment syntax problems.

* src/ftests/fmultiplex2.F:
  - fixed an annoying and long-standing warning message.

* src/solaris-ultra.c:
  - fixed some event definitions.

* src/jni/{EventSet.java, Papi.c, PapiJ.java}:
  - various fixes.

* src/{p4_events.c, perfctr-p4.c, perfctr-p3.c}:
  - fixes in P4 event definitions and in event set handling 
    to make domain settings behave as documented.


Enhancements:
-------------
* src/perfctr-2.6.11:
  - Added Perfctr-2.6.11 to the repository. Please, don't use perfctr-2.4
    unless perfctr-2.6 doesn't work for you. There is NO linkage between 
    perfctr versions and linux kernel versions. Perfctr 2.6 works just fine
    with linux 2.4.

* src/ctests/shlib.c:
  - Added error message to print out a library loading failure.

* src/Rules.perfctr:
  - test for lib64 installation of PerfCtr on x86_64.

* src/ctests/val_omp.c:
  - added new test to catch aix threading problem.

* src/ctests/second.c:
  - updated with more domain tests and better explanations.

* src/{papi.h, linux-memory.c}:
  - modified definitions for cache description structure.

* src/ctests/memory.c: 
  - enhancements for above changes.
