GENERAL NOTES
===============================================================================
This release is primarily a maintenance release for PAPI 3 beta development.
As such, there have been a large number of bug fixes and revisions to the PAPI
system, but a much smaller number of changes that will be visible to the user.

As always, if you identify strange behavior or demonstrable bugs, please
contact the PAPI team or one of the PAPI development lists.

NEW, MODIFIED OR DEPRECATED FEATURES
===============================================================================
* PAPI_get_overflow_event_index() - added to provide better support for overflow
and profiling functions.
* memory information - the structures containing static memory information 
(cache and TLB sizes, etc.) have been reworked. For details see papi.h or
ctests/mem_info.c
* Shared library support has been added where possible. See ctests/shlib.c for 
more information.
* PAPI_get_dmem_info() has been temporarily deprecated, pending a redesign of
the supporting data structures.

PLATFORM NOTES
===============================================================================
* Pentium M support - a native event table was added to explicitly support this 
processor from Intel.
* Opteron is supported in this release, but has not been recently tested, due to
unavailability of our test system.
* Itanium 1 is still supported but has not been recently tested, due to
unavailability of our test systems.
* Make files have been renamed and reworked for Itanium. pfmlib versions are now
automatically identified.
* Make files for linux-perfctr have been reworked. They now support a VERSION
command line parameter to specify the perfctr library version to link to.
The default in both cases is perfctr 2.6.x
* AIX 5.2 is now supported, but a bug in the OS prevents properly clearing the 
counters. This should only affect PAPI_reset. A patch is available from IBM.
Contact the PAPI team for details.
* A bug in Solaris prevents the support of shared library information. We are
investigating a work-around, and will commit it to the cvs tree when available.
Contact the PAPI team for details.
