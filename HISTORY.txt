We're software developers.
That means we're notoriously bad about taking time to document the changes
in the software we develop.

We fully intended to use this file to keep a running history of the changes 
between versions of PAPI.

We didn't do it.

Rather that mislead you with out of date and incomplete information, we
now provide Change Logs for the most recent versions of PAPI. These logs
can be automatically generated and are comprehensive records of all changes
committed to the PAPI source code versioning system (cvs).

Look for a file of the form: 'ChangeLogPxxx.txt' where xxx is the PAPI 
version number. You can grep this file for developer or file names, or
for dates, or for keywords like 'multiplex' or 'overflow' to get an idea
of changes that have occured to the code since the last release.

This is probably like sipping from a firehose, but at least its accurate
and complete. The information's in there...

Enjoy!
