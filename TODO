To Do List for PAPI Documentation
---------------------------------

- Re do the PAPI API Specification/User Manual

- Make PAPI_native man page that shows how to encode native events on all supported platforms

- Make PAPI_multiplex_init man page

- Make PAPI_set_opt man page for multiplexing

- Make PAPI_get_overflow_address, PAPI_lock, PAPI_unlock man pages

- Make PAPI_set_debug, PAPI_write man pages

Comments: Man pages should use the PAPI_query_event page as a template for full markup.

To Do List for PAPI Source Code
-------------------------------

- Make PAPI_query_event check the syntax of native events (will require adding new decoder call to substrate)

- Make PAPI_restore/PAPI_save

1) Revise the list of options, remove SET & GET from the names. That should be
handled by the appropriate code.

2) Rewrite add_test_events & allocate_test_space in test_utils.c
   These functions should be merged into 1 function that returns an
   eventset with some available events added, in addition to memory
   for those event counters.

3) Add more presets to IA64 substrate

4) Add hw profiling to IA64 / IRIX port

5) Add hw overflow to IA32 and update to PerfCtr 2.0

Multiplexing work:

* Implement mpx_remove_event.

* Make mpx_insert_events handle cases where PAPI_add_event and PAPI_start fail.
  This can happen if you want to multiplex a derived event. That event takes up
  two counters, and there is not enough room to add the PAPI_TOT_CYC event.

* Use SIGPROF for both multiplexing and profiling. Both cannot be active at once
  in the same thread. Since signal handlers are shared by all threads, the
  code chain the mpx_handler into the profile_handler. 
  mpx_handler is expensive.

  if (my thread is overflowing)
      overflow_handler
  else if (my thread is multiplexing)
      mpx_handler
  else if       
	abort();

* Make IRIX port, do the right thing when you set the multiplexing
  option. It should not use the MPX code, but rather just change it's
  concept of the maximum number of events. (This will mean a realloc for
  the eventset, which is why SET_MULTIPLEX is an EventSet option.)
