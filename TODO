To Do List for PAPI Documentation
---------------------------------

- Re do the PAPI API Specification/User Manual

- Make PAPI_preset man page that lists all the presets

- Make PAPI_native man page that shows how to encode native events on all supported platforms

- Make PAPI_query_event check the syntax of native events (will require adding new decoder call to substrate)

- Make PAPI_low_level man page that lists the low level API calls and all references

- Make PAPI_high_level man page that lists the high level API calls and all references

- Make PAPI_multiplex_init man page

- Make PAPI_set_opt man page for multiplexing

Comments: Man pages should use the PAPI_query_event page as a template for full markup.

To Do List for PAPI Source Code
-------------------------------

1) Revise the list of options

2) Rewrite add_test_events & allocate_test_space in test_utils.c
   These functions should be merged into 1 function that returns an
   eventset with some available events added, in addition to memory
   for those event counters.

3) Add presets to IA64

4) Add hw profiling to IA64

5) Add hw overflow to IA32

6) Do mpx_remove_event and make mpx_insert_events robust.
