- Make PAPI_preset man page that lists all the presets
- Make PAPI_native man page that shows how to encode native events on all supported platforms
- Make PAPI_query_event check the syntax of native events (will require adding new decoder call to substrate)
- Make PAPI_low_level man page that lists the low level API calls and all references
- Make PAPI_high_level man page that lists the high level API calls and all references

Comments: Man pages should use the PAPI_query_event page as a template for full markup.
