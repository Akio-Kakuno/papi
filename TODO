To Do List for PAPI
-------------------

- find out why profile_pthreads returns empty buffers on POWER4/AIX 5.1

- Docs for trapper, tperfex example

- Make PAPI_query_event check the syntax of native events 
  (will require adding new decoder call to substrate)
  ** DEFERRED TO PAPI 3.0

- Implement PAPI_restore/PAPI_save
  ** DEFERRED TO PAPI 3.0

- Revise the list of options, remove SET & GET from the names. 
  That should be handled by the appropriate code.
  ** DEFERRED TO PAPI 3.0

- Add hw profiling to IA64 / IRIX port
  ** DEFERRED TO PAPI 3.0

Multiplexing work:
------------------

* Implement mpx_remove_event.

* Make mpx_insert_events handle cases where PAPI_add_event and PAPI_start fail.
  This can happen if you want to multiplex a derived event. That event takes up
  two counters, and there is not enough room to add the PAPI_TOT_CYC event.
  [DONE??]

* Use SIGPROF for both multiplexing and profiling. Both cannot be active
  at once in the same thread. Since signal handlers are shared by all threads,
  the code chain the mpx_handler into the profile_handler. 
  mpx_handler is expensive.

  if (my thread is overflowing)
      overflow_handler
  else if (my thread is multiplexing)
      mpx_handler
  else if       
	abort();

* Make IRIX port do the right thing when you set the multiplexing
  option. It should not use the MPX code, but rather just change it's
  concept of the maximum number of events. (This will mean a realloc for
  the eventset, which is why SET_MULTIPLEX is an EventSet option.)

* Make multiplexing monotonically increasing

* Put in check for too short of reads while multiplexing

* All thread signal group function to MPX layer

* Test new MPX layer.

* Remove use of Virtual Timer in MPX layer
